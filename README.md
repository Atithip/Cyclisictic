# Cyclisictic
## Scenario
I am a junior data analyst working on the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago.I am tasked to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. I will approach this task through the Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act phases.
### ASK
The ask phase requires us to answer related questions that will aid the business task, which in this case is to determine the differences in behaviours between casual members and annual members so that design marketing strategies can be implemented to aid in the conversion of casual members into annual members. This is because, the marketing director and the marketing analysis team have came to the conclusion that an annual membership is much more profitable to the company in comparison to a casual membership.

The company has provided the data they collected for the past 12 months to help with this business task. I will be using the language R to prepare, process, and analyse this data. I will then use Tableau to share the results to the stakeholders.

### PREPARE
In the prepare phase, we have to first determine if the data is usable by checking its credibility. I did this by going through the "ROCCC" check (Reliable, Original, Comprehensive, Current, and Cited). After verifying that the 12 months of data provided by Motivate International Inc is credible, I then move on to setting up my studio to process the data. As mentioned before, I will be using R for this phase.

I observed that the data is stored in a ".csv" format (comma seperated values) and that each data set has 13 variables.
